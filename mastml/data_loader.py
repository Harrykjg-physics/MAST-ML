    Method that accepts the filepath of an input data file and returns a full
    dataframe and parsed X and y dataframes

    Args:
        file_path: (str), path to data file

        input_features: (str), column names to be used as input features
                        (X data). If 'Auto', then takes all columns that are
                        not listed in target_feature or feature_blacklist
                        fields.

        target_feature: (str), column name for data to be fit to (y data).

        grouping_feature: (str), column names used to group data in
                          user-defined grouping scheme

    Returns:
        df: (dataframe), full dataframe of the input X data (y data is
            removed)

        X: (dataframe), dataframe containing only the X data from the data
